# Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game (Frogger)

This is a clone of the game Frogger coded using object-oriented JavaScript and a built-in game engine.

## Getting Started

You can play the game [here](https://abhiek187.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## How to Play

Your goal is to reach the water while avoiding the bugs moving across the road. You use the arrow keys to control the player. Reaching the water will score you points, but colliding into a bug will reset the score and send the player back to the start.
